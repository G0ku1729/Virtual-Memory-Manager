# Virtual-Memory-Manager
The project aims to design and implement a virtual memory manager in the C programming language, a crucial component of modern operating systems.

# Key Features
•	The project encompasses essential virtual memory concepts like page tables, page offset extraction, and logical-to-physical address translation.<br>
•	A FIFO algorithm is used for TLB management to ensure efficient updates when new page entries are added.<br>
•	The program calculates and generates statistics, including page faults, TLB hits, and page fault rates.
